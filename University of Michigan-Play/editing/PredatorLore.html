	<h1>Yautja</h1>
	<p>Predator aka the Yautja (Ya-oot-ja) is an alien race that lives for the lust of blood and destruction. We first witnessed history being made in 1987, a group of soldiers led by, Alan Schafer AKA Dutch, were sent on a mission to retrieve an objective.</p>
	
	<p>While stumbling onto a rebel camp, Dutch and his team ambushed the camp of 20; guns blazing and an excessive amount of explosions they clean out the camp. While searching the perimeter, they find a woman who appears to be a rebel; short of her english, she is taken with the team to deliver the information she has.
	</p>

	<p> Heading back to the river for pickup, the men begin to hear voices, voices of the men they had ambushed not too long ago. Billy, who is Dutch's best tracker senses that there is something following the group. A foe of stealth and hunting, lurks within the trees; "there's something in the trees," whispers Billy to Dutch, "not a person, but it lurks right there." Dutch is in disbelief, as he cannot recognise anything lurking in the trees</p>

	<p><em>*BZZZZUPP*</em> the noise of the creatures invisibility cloak goes up, hoping to not be seen or heard from the tracker, Billy. <b>"HAHAHAHA"</b> a laugh echoes in the trees, the soldiers look back at Billy and telling him not to laugh; in confusion, Billy responds that he did not laugh, although it did sound like him... he wasn't lying.</p>
	<p>Ready to waste ammunition, the men begin to prep. Dutch with his hand signals begins to tell the men to open fire, Mac and Blain open fire into a swamp of trees - Dillon lights up the west of the men's position: Poncho and Hawkins remain in the south position... and making sure that the woman they had found doesn't try to make a run for it. Although the men had been opening fire in directions, Dutch had turned to Billy; without being alarmed, Billy had continued to stare into a direction no one had been firing at.</p>

	<p><em>"Cease fire!"</em> yelled Dutch over to the men.</p>

	<p>As the men begin to cease fire, a loud noise of clicking and creaking begins; not knowing what is is, the men begin to hear a mixture of laughter along side the clicking and creaking.</p>

	<p><em>"AHHHHHH!!"</em> Without question, the men hurried over to the direction of the scream, the woman whom they had caught was covered in blood; but it wasn't her blood. "What happened? Who did this?" Dutch had asked the lady, "The jungle... it's... it's alive!" the woman had responded. "Dutch, you're gonna want to see this," Poncho had said to Dutch, "It's... It's Hawkins, he's dead."</p>
